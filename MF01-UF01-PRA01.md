Create a new file named `10_week_plan.md` in your project directory.

#### 2. Markdown Basics

Include the following markdown elements in your file:

- Headers (use different levels)
- Bold and italic text
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Links
- Code blocks
- Blockquotes

Example:

```markdown

#### 3. Create a 10-Week Planning Table

Create a table in your markdown file with the following columns:

- Sprint Number
- Start Date
- End Date
- Main Goal
- Description and contents

Use the first 10 weeks of 2025 for your planning. Each sprint should last two weeks.

Example table structure:

```markdown
| Sprint | Start Date | End Date | Main Goal |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1      | 2025-01-06 | 2025-01-19 | Project Initiation |
| 2      | 2025-01-20 | 2025-02-02 | Feature A Development |
...
```

#### 4. SCRUM Sprint Planning

For each sprint, define a main goal that aligns with SCRUM methodology. Consider including goals such as:

- Sprint Planning
- Feature Development
- Testing and Quality Assurance, so Metrics
- Sprint Review and Retrospective
- Product Backlog Refinement



#### 5.Add your roadmap files

In addition to the sprint planning, include a section in your markdown file that outlines the roadmap you are following for your project. This should include:

- Key milestones
- Major deliverables
- Timeline for completion

Example structure:



```
Project Roadmap
### Milestones
1. **Milestone 1**: Complete initial research by January 12, 2025.
2. **Milestone 2**: Finish development of Feature A by February 16, 2025.
3. **Milestone 3**: Conduct user testing by March 2, 2025.
